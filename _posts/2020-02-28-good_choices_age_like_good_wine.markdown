This may be the best decision i could have chosen for myself i have found many similarites with coding and my life. One is that i can become a very detail oritented person. I believe that naturally being like that helps me understand alot of who I am. Coding is a very deep topic, there is many avenues to take but, I know for a fact that for now I will learn as many languages as possible in order to find my sweet spot.
