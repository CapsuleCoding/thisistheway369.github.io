			Nothing good in life comes without sacrifice, this is a lesson that I've learned in almost any type of situation I have been in. I have no background in coding. I am very new to the field, however I am not shy about tackling new subjects. This is only the beginning of my journey and I believe it will be a very beautiful path. I chose to do software engineering because I know it is something that I will be able to have fun doing. I have always been curious about how to code but never took the first steps. FInally arriving to the this moment, I muswt say it is a great feeling. I am happy that flatiron is giving me this oppurtunity to change my life, and enter a career in which I can create more oppurtunities for myself. 
			Software engineering is a field in which i believe i will be able to work from home and take czare of my 2 year old son. I want to make a difference in his life, and I want to be there for him at all times. Life is precious to me, and I take each day, and the time i spend each day as a gift. I cherish each moment I get to spend with him, and understand that if I want to be able to coninuously do that, I must set myself up in order to give him the life I want him to have. These are my reasons, and I will not fail to satisfy them no matter how tough the road gets.
