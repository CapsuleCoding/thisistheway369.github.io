     Instead of talking about a specific problem in Ruby, whether you are having trouble understanding or just lost in all the new material, I am here to take aim at the a problem we all may be facing. Each and every new problem i approach, i find that their is always a way to undertsnd what the question is asking me. That is by understanding the keywords. Usually the questions use terms such as "if" or "else"  which are huge indicators in solving the problem. Now this may only apply to the lessons that I have been learning in this boot camp and the real field may be different however it is worth taking notice because it will help you understand the theories a lot easier. Keywords give out a understanding or what may be done. Always look for them when trying to figure out what to do or when stuck.
